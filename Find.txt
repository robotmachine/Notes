# Find Notes
#
# find will look in all directories below the one specified. find / will search everything on the computer.
#
# In current directory search for files containing zebra and print them on the screen.
find . -type f -name "*zebra*" -exec echo {} \;
#
# In home directory find mp3 files. Use rsync to copy them to a remote server.
find . -type f -iname "*.mp3" -print0 | xargs -0 -I {} rsync -aP {} -e ssh 10.10.1.40:~/Desktop/
# -print0 will prevent files with spaces or newline characters from ruining things.
# xargs -0 continues the trend.
# -I {} assigns {} as whatever find finds so it can be used by xargs.
